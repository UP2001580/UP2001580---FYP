# UP2001580 - Final Year Project
Final Year Proyect

Games continue to evolve, offering new experiences and challenges to diverse audiences. This project documents the development of a decision-making game using Unity, undertaken through iterative sprints with a focus on testing and refinement. The aim was to push the boundaries of decision-making games on mobile devices, offering players a unique and engaging experience.

The project begins with an analysis of the current landscape of the video game industry and decision-making games on mobile platforms. Despite encountering challenges during development, the core interactions and functionalities of the game were successfully implemented, laying the groundwork for future enhancements.

While the optimization for multi-platform experience, particularly mobile phones, fell short of expectations, the project identifies potential pathways for improvement in this area. By leveraging insights gained from the development process, future iterations of the game can further optimise performance and accessibility across different devices.

On this github, the contet regarding the project will be to deliver an overview of the story breakdown & the code used during the creation of the artefact.
